DVR Live Sample
====================

##Purpose
This sample is intended to show how to quickly integrate the Brightcove-Player-SDK into an iOS application with live HLS.

### How to Run
To run the app, run `pod install` from the root directory. This will install all the required Cocoapods for the project. When finished, open `DVRLive.xcworkspace` using Xcode 6.1 or above.  

This sample doesn't include live HLS demo URL. You will need to add it to the project manually.
